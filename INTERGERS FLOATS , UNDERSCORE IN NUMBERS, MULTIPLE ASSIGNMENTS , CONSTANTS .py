#         INTERGERS FLOATS , UNDERSCORE IN NUMBERS, MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENTS , CONSTANTS 
#  when you divide any two numbers even if they are intergers that result in a whole number you will always get a float
#mixing a integer and a float you will get a float as well example below
# 1+2.0=3.0
#when writing large number you can group them by using underscores  example below
#univers_age=14_000_000_000
#when you prints a number using underscore Python only prints the digits
universe_age=14_000_000_000
print(universe_age)
print(10_00.)
#you can assign values to more than one variable in a single line example below
# x,y,z = 0,0,0

# a constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the value of its life
# Python uses all capitol letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant example shown below
# MAX_CONNECTIONS=5000


print(4+4)
print(2*4)
print(16/2)
#use a variable to represent  your favorite number then say 'my favorite number is '
favorite_number='4'
print("My favorite number is" , favorite_number,)
